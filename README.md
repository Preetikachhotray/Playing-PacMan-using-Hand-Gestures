# TensorFlow.js: Transfer Learning to play Pacman via the Webcam

This example shows how to predict poses from a webcam using transfer
learning.

In this example, we'll use a pretrained [MobileNet](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-examples/tree/master/mobilenet) model and train another model
using an internal mobilenet activation to predict 4 different classes from the
webcam defined by the user.
